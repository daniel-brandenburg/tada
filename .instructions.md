# Core Principles

## Code Quality Standards

- Write clean, readable code: Use meaningful variable names, clear function signatures, and consistent formatting
- Follow established patterns: Maintain consistency with existing codebase architecture and conventions
- Keep functions small and focused: Each function should have a single, well-defined responsibility
- Use appropriate design patterns: Apply SOLID principles and common design patterns where beneficial
- Comment complex logic: Add clear comments for non-obvious business logic or algorithms

## Testing Requirements

- Test-driven approach: Write tests for every new feature before or alongside implementation
- Comprehensive coverage: Aim for high test coverage, focusing on critical paths and edge cases
- Test types: Include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests as appropriate
- Test naming: Use descriptive test names that clearly explain what is being tested
- Test isolation: Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order

## Development Workflow

- Run tests after changes: Execute the full test suite after every feature implementation or refactor
- Verify test passage: Ensure all tests pass before considering a task complete
- Fix failing tests immediately: Address any test failures before moving to new features
- Refactor with confidence: Use tests as a safety net when improving code structure

# Implementation Guidelines

## Code Structure

- Modular architecture: Organize code into logical modules with clear boundaries
- Dependency management: Keep dependencies minimal and well-managed
- Error handling: Implement proper error handling and logging throughout the application
- Configuration management: Externalize configuration and use environment-specific settings
- Documentation: Maintain up-to-date README files and inline documentation

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize thoughtfully: Profile before optimizing and focus on actual bottlenecks
- Resource management: Properly handle memory, file handles, and network connections
- Caching strategies: Implement appropriate caching where beneficial
- Database optimization: Use efficient queries and proper indexing

## Security Best Practices

- Input validation: Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Authentication/Authorization: Implement proper security controls
- Secrets management: Never hardcode sensitive information
- Security updates: Keep dependencies updated and monitor for vulnerabilities

# Testing Strategy
## Unit Tests

- Test individual functions and methods in isolation
- Mock external dependencies and services
- Cover both happy path and error scenarios
- Aim for fast execution times

## Integration Tests

- Test interactions between different modules
- Verify database operations and external API calls
- Test configuration and environment setup

## End-to-End Tests

- Test complete user workflows
- Verify system behavior from user perspective
- Include critical business processes

## Test Maintenance

- Keep tests simple and maintainable
- Refactor tests when refactoring code
- Remove or update obsolete tests
- Ensure test data is properly managed

# Continuous Improvement

- Run all tests and ensure they pass
- Check code formatting and linting
- Verify documentation is updated
- Confirm no debug code or TODOs remain

## Review Checklist

- Code follows established patterns and conventions
- Tests are comprehensive and meaningful
- Performance implications are considered
- Security best practices are followed
- Documentation is clear and accurate

## Refactoring Guidelines

Refactor incrementally with tests as safety net
Maintain backward compatibility when possible
Update documentation after structural changes
Consider performance impact of changes

## Learning and Adaptation

Stay updated with best practices for the technology stack
Learn from code review feedback
Continuously improve testing strategies
Monitor and address technical debt

# Communication

## Documentation Standards

Keep README files current with setup and usage instructions
Document API changes and breaking changes
Maintain changelog for significant updates
Include examples in documentation

## Progress Reporting

Clearly communicate when tests pass or fail
Explain reasoning behind architectural decisions
Highlight any blockers or concerns
Provide context for complex implementations

Remember: The goal is maintainable, reliable software. When in doubt, prioritize clarity and correctness over cleverness.
